cs2500-client
==========

Handin client package CS2500.

The server-cert.pem needs to be installed in cs2500-client, then the package can be built or installed. `distribute-plt` gives an example of how to build the .plt file to install the package.

# Install instructions
Install instructions:
```raco pkg install github://github.com/bluephoenix47/cs2500-client/f14```

Make sure not to use the master branch, as it doesn't contain the server's certificate. Instead, use the semester specific branch, such as `f14` for fall 2014, or `sp15` for spring 2015.

Update instructions:
```raco pkg update cs2500-client```

# Branches
There are branches for each semester starting Fall 2014 that enable the client to be installed directly from a github URL, using Racket Install Package features.

# How to create a new semester's client
Each semester, update the web-address variable in cs2500-client/info.rkt. You must also add the file `server-cert.pem` generated by the server to cs2500-client, or clients will received `connection refused` when attempting to access the server.

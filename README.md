cs2500-client
==========

Handin client package CS2500. 

The server-cert.pem needs to be installed in cs2500-client, then the package can be built or installed. `distribute-plt` gives an example of how to build the .plt file to install the package.

# Branches
There are branches for each semester starting Fall 2014 that enable the client to be installed directly from a github URL, using Racket Install Package features.

There is also a variant of the client for the grading server for each semester.

# How to update
Each semester, update the web-address variable in cs2500-client/info.rkt. You must also add the file `server-cert.pem` generated by the server to cs2500-client, or clients will received `connection refused` when attempting to access the server.
